# Connect4-AI-Implementation


## Implementation Details
- Connect 4 is implemented using pygame and NumPy libraries.
- The game consists of a 6x7 grid, where players drop tokens to fill the grid vertically.
- Player 1 is denoted by 1, and Player 2 is denoted by 2.
- The goal is to connect four tokens in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game.
-Two algorithms are implemented for playing Connect 4:
  -Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
  -Tabular Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm
## Running the Game
- Run the connect_4.py file to play Connect 4 against a default opponent.
- Click on the desired column to drop a token.
## Algorithm Comparison
The implemented algorithms are compared against a default opponent.
The report provides analysis and conclusions based on the algorithm performance in terms of winning percentages and draws.
